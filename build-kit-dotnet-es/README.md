# build-kit-dotnet-es

Turns eventmodelers.ai board slices into working code for a Wolverine.Http +
Marten + RabbitMQ .NET solution, using Marten's **event-sourcing mode
exclusively** — no document-store branch, no per-module storage decision.

**Status: untested.** This is a generic template forked from
`build-kit-dotnet` (this repo's own K9Crush-specific kit) after that
project's ADR-031 retrofit proved out "event-sourced everywhere, with
selective Inline snapshots" as the right default. It has not yet been run
against a real board or a real .NET solution — treat the Node tooling and
skill instructions as a first draft to validate on the next project that
uses it, not as something already exercised end-to-end.

## Why a separate kit instead of editing build-kit-dotnet in place

`build-kit-dotnet`'s code-gen skills (at this repo's root `.claude/skills/`)
encode a **per-module** choice between Marten-as-document-store and
Marten-as-event-store, because that project hadn't settled the question
when those skills were written. It has settled it since — every module was
retrofitted to event sourcing (see this repo's git history: "retrofit
\<Module\> to event sourcing (ADR-031 Phase N/5)"). Rather than edit that
project's own skills to remove a decision framework that's specific to how
*that* project got there, this kit exists to be a clean starting point for
any *new* project that already knows it wants event sourcing from slice
one — no per-slice "check the module's config to see which pattern this
one uses" step, because there's only one pattern.

## What's different from build-kit-dotnet

- **`build-state-change`**: Step 2 (the document-vs-event-sourced fork) is
  gone. Every entity is a self-aggregating `Create`/`Apply` event stream.
  Folds in the lessons from K9Crush's retrofit as first-class guidance
  rather than after-the-fact fixes: `[JsonInclude]`/`[JsonConstructor]` is
  called out up front (not discovered via a `NotSupportedException` on the
  first real read), the Inline-snapshot decision is its own explicit step
  (add one only when a read model queries the entity by id — never by
  default), and the two concurrency exception types
  (`JasperFx.ConcurrencyException` vs.
  `Marten.Exceptions.ConcurrentUpdateException`) are documented together
  since a real race condition is what it took to find both.
- **`build-state-view`**: clarifies explicitly that "event-sourced only"
  describes the *write side* — read-model documents (whether projector-built
  or an entity's own Inline snapshot read back directly) are still plain
  Marten documents. This isn't a carve-out from the event-sourcing rule;
  it's what the rule was always about.
- **`build-automation`**: the document-store branch (loading a plain
  document instead of computing decision state) is gone. Also makes
  explicit that an automation's own decision state
  (`AggregateStreamAsync`-computed, single-purpose, never persisted, never
  shared across handlers) is a *different* rule from an entity's Inline
  snapshot (durable, shared, meant to be queried) — the original
  `build-kit-dotnet` skills stated the "never a shared persisted snapshot"
  rule in a way that, read after ADR-031 landed, looked like it contradicted
  Inline snapshots outright. It doesn't — they're answering two different
  questions — but the original phrasing didn't make that clear, so this
  version says so directly.
- **`connect` / `load-slice` / `update-slice-status` / `learn-eventmodelers-api`**:
  unchanged in substance, just re-pointed at this kit's own paths
  (`build-kit-dotnet-es/...` instead of `build-kit-dotnet/...`) and
  genericized (`<SolutionName>`, `<path-to-your-.NET-solution>` placeholders
  instead of `K9Crush`/`code/K9Crush-scaffold/K9Crush`).
- **Node tooling** (`ralph-claude.js`, `ralph-ollama.js`, `ralph.sh`,
  `realtime-agent.js`, `code-export.mjs`, `lib/*`): copied verbatim except
  for the `project_dir` default. `build-kit-dotnet` hardcoded
  `code/K9Crush-scaffold/K9Crush` as its default; this kit has no fixed
  project to default to, so `project_dir` is now **required** — pass it as
  an argument or set `DOTNET_PROJECT_DIR`.

```

Self-contained on purpose: unlike `build-kit-dotnet` (a sibling of its
target project, code-gen skills living separately at the repo root because
that layout was already established), this kit carries its own
`.claude/skills/` so the whole thing can be dropped into a fresh repo as a
single unit and be immediately discoverable by Claude Code.

## Setting up in a new project

1. Copy this whole `build-kit-dotnet-es/` directory into the target repo
   (as a sibling of the .NET solution, or wherever suits that repo's
   layout — nothing here assumes a specific position other than "somewhere
   inside the repo, so `connect`'s ancestor-walk for `.eventmodelers/config.json`
   can find it").
2. Find-and-replace the placeholders used throughout the skills and
   `AGENT.md`:
   - `<SolutionName>` — your solution's root namespace (e.g. what
     `K9Crush` was for the source project — `<SolutionName>.Modules.<Context>.Api`,
     `<SolutionName>.Api.Host`, etc.)
   - `<path-to-your-.NET-solution>` — the relative path from repo root to
     your `.sln` file's directory
3. `npm install` (once, for `@supabase/supabase-js`).
4. Run the `connect` skill (or just start using any other skill — they all
   invoke `connect` first) to set up `.eventmodelers/config.json`.
5. Confirm your project's `Program.cs` has the event-sourcing wiring the
   skills assume: `AddMarten(...).IntegrateWithWolverine()`, module-owned
   `IMartenModuleConfiguration.Configure(StoreOptions)` implementations
   setting `options.Events.DatabaseSchemaName`, and a central exception
   handler mapping `JasperFx.ConcurrencyException`/
   `Marten.Exceptions.ConcurrentUpdateException` to `409 Conflict`. None of
   the skills set this up for you — they assume it's already there, the
   same way the source project's skills did.
6. Install the pre-checkin quality gate: create
   `<target-solution-root>/.claude/settings.json` registering
   `hooks/quality-gate.sh` as a `PreToolUse` hook on the `Bash` matcher,
   and add `.claude/state/` to the target solution's own `.gitignore` —
   see `hooks/README.md` for the exact config and why it has to live in
   the *target solution's* `.claude/` folder, not this kit's.
7. Start building slices — `build-state-change` for commands,
   `build-state-view` for read models, `build-automation` for event-triggered
   reactions. Once several slices exist as `Planned` on a chapter, use
   `orchestrate.mjs` (below) to build a whole chapter unattended instead of
   running one slice at a time through the skills manually.

## Running

```bash
npm install   # once, for @supabase/supabase-js

# Ralph — the autonomous loop + realtime board subscription. project_dir
# is required (no default — see "What's different" above).
node ralph-claude.js /path/to/your/solution
DOTNET_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/your/solution node ralph-claude.js

# Local Ollama model instead of Claude Code
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3:8b node ralph-ollama.js /path/to/your/solution   # run `ollama serve` first

# Bash-only alternative to the JS entry points
./ralph.sh [iterations] /path/to/your/solution

# CodeExport — local bridge server for the eventmodelers.ai web UI
node code-export.mjs
PORT=3002 WORKSPACE_PATH=/path/to/repo node code-export.mjs
```

### Orchestrating a whole chapter

Instead of running Ralph once and leaving it to poll one context at a time,
`orchestrate.mjs` retrofits missing slices onto a chapter, flips everything
in it to `Planned`, and starts N Ralph instances against it in parallel —
each in its own git worktree, so concurrent instances never race each
other's file writes in a shared working tree (a real, previously-confirmed
failure mode — see `AGENT.md`'s "Concurrent Ralph agents" entries for what
happens without this).

```bash
# Interactive — lists chapters on the board, prompts for a number
node orchestrate.mjs /path/to/your/solution

# Non-interactive — build a named chapter with 3 parallel instances,
# give up watching (not stop) after 90 minutes if it's not done by then
node orchestrate.mjs /path/to/your/solution "Shelter Reviews Application" --parallel 3 --timeout-minutes 90

# Resume watching a chapter you already started in another terminal
node orchestrate.mjs /path/to/your/solution "Shelter Reviews Application" --watch

# After killing instances early (or a --watch timeout), merge+clean up
# whatever worktree branches exist without needing the chapter name again
node orchestrate.mjs /path/to/your/solution --merge --parallel 3
```

Each instance's git worktree lives as a sibling directory
(`<solution-dir>-ralph-1`, `-ralph-2`, ...) on branch `ralph/instance-N`,
off whatever branch you were on when you ran the command. Once every
tracked slice in the chapter reaches `Done` or `Blocked`, each instance's
branch is merged back automatically; its worktree is only removed if it's
actually clean afterward (`git status --porcelain` empty) — a Ralph loop
can pick up a new Planned slice from elsewhere on the board the instant its
tracked one finishes, so the worktree is left in place with instructions
printed if it still has uncommitted changes, rather than force-deleted.
Per-instance output goes to `ralph-1.log`/`ralph-2.log`/... in this
directory (not the terminal) — `orchestrate.mjs` itself only prints its own
retrofit/flip/watch progress. Per-slice `InProgress`→terminal timing is
appended to `slice-timings.jsonl` as it happens, plus a running average
printed at the end of each watch.

Two `.eventmodelers/config.json` fields (optional, read by `lib/ralph.js`,
not by `orchestrate.mjs` itself) matter more once you're running several
instances unattended:
- `maxSlicesPerRun` — a Ralph instance exits cleanly after building this
  many slices, instead of polling forever. Useful for bounding a single
  `--parallel` run's blast radius.
- `maxBudgetUsdPerSlice` — passed to `claude -p` as `--max-budget-usd`, a
  per-slice spend cap (`ralph-claude.js` only).

Both are absent by default (no cap) — set them in `.eventmodelers/config.json`
alongside `token`/`boardId`/etc. if you want them.

## Config

Credentials (board id, token, org id, base URL) come from
`<repo-root>/.eventmodelers/config.json` — shared with the `connect` skill,
gitignored. `lib/ralph.js`'s config loader walks up from
`build-kit-dotnet-es/` through ancestor directories to find it. Note:
`ralph.sh` only checks `build-kit-dotnet-es/.eventmodelers/config.json`
directly, not ancestors — use `ralph-claude.js` if you rely on a repo-root
copy without one directly here.
